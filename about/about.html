                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey there. I'm Jepchirchir Mercy, but you can call me Mercy Melly—or MM if you're feeling fancy.I love a good conversation, so whether it's a simple hello or a deep dive into random topics, I'm always up for it.</p>
                <p> I am a creative soul with a love for all things hands-on and expressive. When I'm not lost in my latest crochet project, you'll probably find me dreaming up new hobbies to dive into—because why settle for just one?</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm on a mission to explore cadistry (because who doesn't want to master the art of card flourishing?), play the piano (slowly but surely), and learn multiple languages. Korean, Chinese, Spanish... yep, it's a lot, but I love the challenge. And let's not forget sign language—it holds a special place in my heart.</p>
                <p>Life is too short to stick to just one thing, so I'm embracing all the little passions that make me, well… me. Whether it's crafting, learning, or just figuring things out as I go, I'm all about enjoying the journey. </p>

                    <h3>My Education</h3>
                    <p>I'm currently in my final year at the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton, pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. It's been a wild ride—full of late-night study sessions, and plenty of learning beyond just the classroom. With graduation around the corner, I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next.</p>
                    <p>Before that, I was at Moi Girls High School, Eldoret, where I sat for my KCSE and got a B+. My primary school days were at Tindiret Educational Center and School, where I scored 361 marks in KCPE. Good times, simpler times.</p>
